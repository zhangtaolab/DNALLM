      "- **Prediction**: Labeled as **\"Core promoter\"** with 94% confidence.\n",
      "- **Biological Significance**:\n",
      "  - This sequence is likely a **transcription start site (TSS)** or a **core promoter region** critical for initiating gene transcription.\n",
      "  - Core promoters typically include elements like the **TATA box**, **Nucleosome Remodeling Domain (NRD)**, or **Inr motifs**.\n",
      "  - The high score suggests this region is actively involved in **RNA polymerase II recruitment** and **cis-regulatory control**.\n",

      "- **Biological Significance**:\n",
      "  - The sequence corresponds to an **open chromatin region** (e.g., **enhancer**, **promoter**, or **regulatory island**).\n",
      "  - Open chromatin is typically **accessible to transcription factors (TFs)** and **epigenetic modifiers**, enabling **gene activation**.\n",
