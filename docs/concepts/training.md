# Training Concepts in Machine Learning

Training is the fundamental process in machine learning where a model learns patterns from data to make predictions or perform tasks. This document explains the core concepts of training and provides practical examples using DNALLM for DNA language models.

## What is Training in Machine Learning?

Training is the process of optimizing a model's parameters (weights and biases) to minimize a loss function, enabling the model to learn meaningful patterns from data. In the context of DNA language models, training involves:

- **Parameter Optimization**: Adjusting model weights to minimize prediction errors
- **Pattern Learning**: Discovering biological patterns and relationships in DNA sequences
- **Representation Learning**: Learning meaningful embeddings for DNA tokens and sequences
- **Task Adaptation**: Fine-tuning for specific biological tasks and applications
