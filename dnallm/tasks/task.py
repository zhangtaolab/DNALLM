"""DNA Language Model Fine-tuning Task Definition Module.

This module defines various task types and related components supported by DNA language models
during fine-tuning, including:

1. TaskType: Task type enumeration
   - Binary classification (BINARY): e.g., promoter prediction, enhancer identification
   - Multi-class classification (MULTICLASS): e.g., protein family classification, functional region classification
   - Regression (REGRESSION): e.g., expression level prediction, binding strength prediction
   - Token classification (NER): Named Entity Recognition tasks
   - Generation and embedding tasks for different model architectures

2. TaskConfig: Task configuration class
   - Configures task type, number of labels, label names, etc.
   - Provides threshold settings for binary classification tasks

3. TaskHead: Task-specific prediction heads
   - Provides specialized neural network layers for different task types
   - Supports feature dimensionality reduction and dropout to prevent overfitting
   - Automatically selects output dimensions based on task type

4. compute_metrics: Evaluation metric computation
   - Binary: accuracy, F1 score
   - Multi-class: accuracy, macro F1, weighted F1
   - Regression: mean squared error, R-squared value

Usage example:
    task_config = TaskConfig(
        task_type=TaskType.BINARY,
        num_labels=2,
        label_names=["negative", "positive"]
    )
