# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-01)

**Core value:** A fully passing pytest suite with >90% line coverage across `dnallm/` (excluding vendored code), enforced by a CI hard gate so coverage cannot regress.
**Current focus:** v1.1 Phase 5 — Execution Harness, Honest Gates & Runner Feasibility

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 9 (v1.1: phase 1 of 5) — Execution Harness, Honest Gates & Runner Feasibility
Plan: None yet (phase not planned)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-10-01 — v1.1 roadmap created (Phases 5–9, 32/32 requirements mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 13 (all in v1)
- Average duration: ~39 min
- Total execution time: ~9.1 hours

**By Phase (v1.1):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 05 | TBD | - | - |
| 06 | TBD | - | - |
| 07 | TBD | - | - |
| 08 | TBD | - | - |
| 09 | TBD | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans (v1 close): 44, 27, 52, 51, 39 min
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work (v1.1 roadmap):

- Roadmap: 5 phases numbered 5–9 (continues v1, which ended at Phase 4); test-layer vertical (5, 8, 9) and example vertical (6, 7) touch disjoint files — 5 and 6 parallelizable
- Roadmap: harness + honest gates first (research consensus) — WR-08/09 and the docs-mirror drift closure land together in Phase 5 so every later repair rides an enforced lane
- Roadmap: truth agreement asserted as calibrated floors with tolerance bands, never exact outputs (transformers 4.49–5.x span)
- Roadmap: GB10 feasibility verdicts (evo-1/evo2/megaDNA/pyBigWig) precede execution-test authoring; `environment-unavailable:` typed skips only with recorded evidence
- Roadmap: separate example-execution nightly job pre-authorized by owner if total runtime exceeds the 900-min nightly (CI-06)
- Carried from v1 (AUDIT-04): kernel subprocesses are unmeasured by design — example execution must not move the 96.30% gate (documented in Phase 9)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Runtime budget risk: ~24 new slow tests with naive serial ceilings 14–48h vs the 900-min nightly job — measure per-artifact budgets during the Phase 5 pilot and Phase 8 rollout; escalation pre-authorized (CI-06)
- From v1 ship triage (still open, live in /gsd-ship ledger): WR-01 nightly test-mamba continue-on-error; WR-02 plot.py prepare_data drops task_type; WR-03 workflows README stale — note WR-08/09 are v1.1 Phase 5 scope, these three are not
- GitHub cache quota: evo-1 is a 29.7GB repo against a 10GB cache quota — safetensors-only `allow_patterns` + giant tier outside cached paths is Phase 8 scope (CI-05)

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and deferred at milestone close, most recent first:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At | Milestone |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| deferred_items | 03/deferred-items.md: import-time `logs/dnallm.log` sink recreated under pytest cwd every run (`DNALLMLogger._setup_handlers`, logger.py:57-60) | acknowledged | 2026-10-01 | v1 |
| deferred_items | 03/deferred-items.md: test_timeout.py fixed ~60s cost from two full-30s-timeout waits (shorten `_tool_timeout_seconds` like `test_timeout_configurable` does) | acknowledged | 2026-10-01 | v1 |
| deferred_items | `DNADataset.raw_reverse_complement` no-op — `ds.map` result discarded (data.py:983), latent bug pinned as-is by test | acknowledged | 2026-10-01 | v1 |

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-10-01T16:00Z
Stopped at: v1.1 roadmap created (Phases 5–9, 32/32 requirements mapped) — ready to plan Phase 5
Resume file: None

## Deferred Verification

| Phase | State | Resume |
|-------|-------|--------|
| *(none — v1 phase 4 verification closed 2026-10-01, passed 10/10)* | | |

## Operator Next Steps

- Plan Phase 5 with `/gsd-plan-phase 5` (Phase 6 is an independent parallel track if desired)
